# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._
- The application must enable users to manage teams responsible for green space maintenance.
- It must facilitate the allocation of teams to specific green spaces.
- Users should be able to manage the organization's fleet of vehicles, machinery, and equipment.
- The application should optimize irrigation and lighting systems for green spaces.
- Users must be able to generate statistical indicators to assess the performance of green space management activities.
## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for efficient use.
- The system must provide a responsive interface to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Reliability

_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

- The System must be invulnerable to crashes and data loss.
- The System must be prepared of handling multiple users at the same time without losing performance.

## Performance

_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

- The system must provide fast response times for search and retrieval of property data.

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._
